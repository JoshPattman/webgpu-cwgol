# Conways Game of Life using WebGPU
This is a toy project which I created to learn how to use WebGPU with Go. I am most interested in the compute capabilities of WebGPU, so have left all the rendering of this project to `gopxl/pixel`.

It is not particularly optimised, and was more intended as a learning exercise than anything else.
